An entity's behaviortree ticks (or doesn't) based on if it is awake or not.
Same with detection

Try putting detection + behavior ina  thread

Camera movement also seems weirdly expensive? Can THAT be threaded?

Entities wake up if they are near a player

could also just try dumping it into another process
