 Ideal description:
    Bodies enter the very large 'detection area' present on an entity.
    Any objects in that area are assigned to the "tracked entities" array in the EntityDetector node
    The signal appears offset from the actual position with some kind of uncertainty modifier.
    The signal updates to a new location if the target's actual position exceeds some kind of threshold
    Proposal: 600km when last at 20%, 50km when at 90%+, so closer targets update more frequently.

    Signals should be clickable, and open the side panel (or mid panel)
    
Current description:
    Currently, the detection system works by giving entities a massive detection area
    Any objects in that area are assigned to a "tracked_entities" array in the EntityDetector node.
