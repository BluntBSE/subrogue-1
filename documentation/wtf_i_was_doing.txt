DONT FORGET:
The invalid path to node bug at the project start is a known bug in Godot: https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/27790

You currently set speed pretty directly in apply_entity_type. You'll have to change this once different speeds are at hing.

We're making the find/attack target stuff generic to promote npc interactions,
but I think something like a "player bias" would be helpful, that is
skewing interactions towards interacting with the player vs npcs,
but not so much the player can't bamboozle the AI.

BUG: If you get lucky and click on a unit directly, you can get its proper identification right away. No!
BUG: Your control focus thing didn't really pan out.


CONSIDER:
Make the sonar width and heading controllable from inside the 3d gamespace?        
IDK YET: Give signals a heading sprite? Possibly as an upgrade
IDK YET: How long does positive ID last? - Give sonar signal objects a lifespan after a life ping before they do the C100 thing.
IF NEEDED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE: Maybe only turn on NPC "Brains" if a player wanders within some large distance. Kind of like an AI 'chunking' that way. 
IF NEEDED TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE: All that ping polling and stuff could be on different threads. NPCs and players could use separate threads. Don't need to track OTHER player's signals either.

!!!!YOUR WHOLE NAVIGATION SYSTEM ADDS NODES TO THE TREE. THAT IS PROBABLY PRETTY EXPENSIVE IN A BEHAVIOR TREE!!!!!

BUG
NOT QUITE A BUG BUT: Adding and removing nodes is super expensive, and both munition pathfinding and mouse movement do this every frame.
NOT QUITE A BUG BUT: SonarPulseMesh is the culprit, defer its material duplication to unpack. --- Try instance uniforms again


QUESTS:
    
START June 01 2025
-Regroup city UI
-Add city UI states
-Debug City click not working any more


TODO:
in no particular order:
    Quest system
    Munitions can't hit docked people
    
    Implement a hail workflow
        -Probably just telling the player to back off if spotted
        -Make factions that don't hate eachother swim on by
        
    Make hostilities only occur between two factions that hate each other
    
    Get a mission to destroy ships of a type
    Get a you died screen going
    
    Update munition UI for player to reflect what they actually have?
    Update munition AI to not try to shoot if you're out of amom
    Fix the runaway time (3s is possibly too long. Move to nearby node might be better than flee 'away''

For munition behavior:
    Create a behaviorprofile class that orders branches
    How? Each behaviorprofile has a dict. The keys match to Node names, the values to their desired index.
    Anything not in the behaviorprofile dict goes to the end of the tree, perhaps below a fallback node that always goes after the defined behaviors
    I guess that means we probably don't need the core behaviors enum

    
    


IDEAS:
    
    MUNITIONS - Maybe we shouldn't add_child at runtime, but reveal munitions from an offscreen pool?
    MUNITIONS - DO THEY OVERRIDE THEIR CHECK WAYPOINT REACHED AND JUST KEEP GOING?

    
    Sounds (and other emissions) are achieved by creating a large 3d shape around the emitter,
    where the edge of the shape represents the smallest unit detectable (such as 1DB)
    This large 3D shape clips with the terrain.
    If an entity with a LISTENING flag is within the shape, it measures its distance from the emitter across the curve of the sphere.
    With that distance. Given the POWER of the signal and the SENSITIVITY of the listener, do the following:
    
    If Signal POWER is within the SENSITIVITY limit of the listener, create a SignalDetectedNode.
    
    Signal detected nodes do not positively identify the object, but provide a node to pathfind to. Perhaps some variance is introduced to the position of the node based on sensitivity.
    A SignalDetectedNode knows what it's parented to, so updates to a SignalDetectedNode are tracked to the object they belong to.
    
    
    For the player, the player must choose to save these nodes to the screen, else they disappear after a certain amount of time.
