The harbor is crowded with trawlers and research vessels, their crews swapping stories and contraband beneath flickering streetlights. The cityâ€™s narrow streets are alive with the scent of salt and solder, as engineers and smugglers barter over AI-driven navigation systems. Here, the past is never far away, but neither is the next big upgrade."
