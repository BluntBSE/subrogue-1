The circle math on the camera might still be at odds with the circle math used elsewhere. vOv?

next: Create a tool to paint collision shapes.


Avoid colliding with land:
    
    invisible colliders that protrude from the land that I draw in 3D?
    mapping clicks and movement on the outside to a subviewport scene2D?
    
    

NOTES:
    Remember that you're using collision masks on the camera, the waypoints, and the clickable sphere.

IDEAS:
    
    Sounds (and other emissions) are achieved by creating a large 3d shape around the emitter,
    where the edge of the shape represents the smallest unit detectable (such as 1DB)
    This large 3D shape clips with the terrain.
    If an entity with a LISTENING flag is within the shape, it measures its distance from the emitter across the curve of the sphere.
    With that distance. Given the POWER of the signal and the SENSITIVITY of the listener, do the following:
    
    If Signal POWER is within the SENSITIVITY limit of the listener, create a SignalDetectedNode.
    
    Signal detected nodes do not positively identify the object, but provide a node to pathfind to. Perhaps some variance is introduced to the position of the node based on sensitivity.
    A SignalDetectedNode knows what it's parented to, so updates to a SignalDetectedNode are tracked to the object they belong to.
    
    
    For the player, the player must choose to save these nodes to the screen, else they disappear after a certain amount of time.
